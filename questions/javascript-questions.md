# JS Questions:

* Explain event delegation

Let the parent handles events that occur on its child nodes. Why? It can boost performance.

* Explain how `this` works in JavaScript

Use the following 4 rules (in the order of precedence) to determine what `this` refers to:
1. `new`
2. `call`, `apply`, and `bind`
3. `Object.method()`
4. default to globel like (`document` in browser, `global` in node)
* Explain how prototypal inheritance works

Javascript achieved inheritance through prototype chain. Even the keyword `class` is just a syntax sugar to `function`.
```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor() {
    this.weight = 1;
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.name = 'dog';
  }
  
  bark() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}

// Equivalent to below using Babel
"use strict";

var _createClass = (function() {
  function defineProperties(target, props) {
    for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) {
      var descriptor = props[i];
      descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false;
      descriptor.configurable = true;
      if ("value" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true;
      Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor);
    }
  }
  return function(Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) {
    if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps);
    if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps);
    return Constructor;
  };
})();

function _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) {
  if (!self) {
    throw new ReferenceError(
      "this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called"
    );
  }
  return call && (typeof call === "object" || typeof call === "function")
    ? call
    : self;
}

function _inherits(subClass, superClass) {
  if (typeof superClass !== "function" && superClass !== null) {
    throw new TypeError(
      "Super expression must either be null or a function, not " +
        typeof superClass
    );
  }
  subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, {
    constructor: {
      value: subClass,
      enumerable: false,
      writable: true,
      configurable: true
    }
  });
  if (superClass)
    Object.setPrototypeOf
      ? Object.setPrototypeOf(subClass, superClass)
      : (subClass.__proto__ = superClass);
}

//
function _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) {
  if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) {
    throw new TypeError("Cannot call a class as a function");
  }
}

var Animal = function Animal() {
  _classCallCheck(this, Animal); // Ensure Animal is called as a constructor function

  this.weight = 1;
};

var Dog = (function(_Animal) {
  _inherits(Dog, _Animal);

  function Dog() {
    _classCallCheck(this, Dog);

    var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(
      this,
      (Dog.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(Dog)).call(this)
    );

    _this.name = "dog";
    return _this;
  }

  _createClass(Dog, [
    {
      key: "bark",
      value: function bark() {
        console.log(this.name);
      }
    }
  ]);

  return Dog;
})(Animal);
